- To have a simple (one-two files) handler to a trained GAN (/...) model for easy interaction.

- Ideally end up with only:

  - init
  - report // your internal status and what you need / give
  - out=infer(in)
  - set_mode // (opt) setting mode of the models, some large changes, if the model supports them

- Finally this would be added to a separate interactive code - which would figure out rendering and interactivity separately, simply using these calls.

Why? (You might ask) Because in my previous experience using these was unwieldy and one looses more time on dealing with details that with creating something interesting (so kinda transform a code/research/idea into tool).
